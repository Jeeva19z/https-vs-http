  <title>HTML vs HTM</title>

<h2>The difference between HTML and HTM files:</h2>

<h3>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):</h3>
<p>Files with the ".html" extension are HTML files. HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML files contain the code that defines the structure and content of a webpage. HTML files can be opened and rendered by web browsers.</p>

<h3>HTM (Hypertext Markup Language):</h3>
<p>Files with the ".htm" extension are also HTML files. The only difference is the file extension. Historically, some older operating systems, such as MS-DOS and Windows 3.x, imposed a three-character limit on file extensions, leading to the use of ".htm" instead of ".html". However, both ".html" and ".htm" files contain the same HTML code and can be used interchangeably.</p>

<p>In summary, both HTML and HTM files contain HTML markup, but the only difference lies in the file extension used to denote them. Modern systems typically use ".html" as the standard extension for HTML files, but both ".html" and ".htm" are recognized by web browsers and can be used to create web pages.</p>
