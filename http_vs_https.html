  <title>HTTP vs HTTPS</title>

<h2>The main difference between HTTP and HTTPS:</h2>

<h3>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):</h3>
<ul>
  <li>HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.</li>
  <li>It is a protocol used for transmitting data over the internet.</li>
  <li>Data transmitted via HTTP is not encrypted, which means it can be intercepted and read by third parties.</li>
  <li>It is typically used for transmitting data that doesn't require high security, such as web pages that don't involve sensitive information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):</h3>
<ul>
  <li>HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure.</li>
  <li>It is a secure version of HTTP.</li>
  <li>HTTPS encrypts the data transmitted between the client (such as a web browser) and the server, making it much more secure.</li>
  <li>It uses SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) protocols to establish an encrypted connection.</li>
  <li>HTTPS is commonly used for transmitting sensitive information over the internet, such as login credentials, payment details, and personal information on websites.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, the key difference is that HTTPS encrypts data, providing a higher level of security compared to HTTP, which transmits data in plain text.</p>
